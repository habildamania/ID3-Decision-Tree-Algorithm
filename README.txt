# Assignment-2: Decision Tree

This assignment creates a decision tree on an input dataset (Credit Approval Dataset) from UCI's Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is divided into training and testing parts and the accuracy on test is computed

### Prerequisites

System must have python interpretor with data science libraries like sklearn, math, pandas installed

### Executing the code

To execute the code, the two files : DecisionTree.py and driver.py must be saved in the same directory on the system.
After doing that, executing just the driver.py will output the required result.
Note: Every time a change is made in DecisionTree.py, only the driver.py should be executed


## Output
The output will display all the necessary properties and results that were required in the assignment. The datasets before and after prunning can be seen in the output of the code.
The accuracy before and after prunning is also seen in the output.
We have attached an output.txt file with our assignment which shows the output we obtained on our latest execution. 

##Extra Material
The answers to question 1 and 2 of the non programming part are uploaded with the assignment in the Assignment2DT.pdf
A report on the programming part stating our results and prunning strategy is also included in the Assignment2DT.pdf
